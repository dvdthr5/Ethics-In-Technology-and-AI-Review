## Algorithmic Bias

Although being built off of data leads people to believe that algorithms are unbiassed, biasses occur in the data in many different ways, which biasses the output of said algorithm.

### The Mirroring Problem

The mirroring problem is when faulty, 'garbage' data has been fed into a system that mirrors into the results, such as a company suggesting a man over a women, when they have the same qualifications. 

### The Ratcheting Problem

The ratcheting problem is similar to the mirroring probelm in the sense that garbage data is what starts the issue, but in the ratcheting problem, the data is fed back into the algorithms, in a way that further distorts the data, such as the company that hires the man over the women, retraining the model on their new hiring data, further creating a gender disparity. 

### Sampling Bias

Sampling bias is when the sample that the data was collected from is not representative of the entire population, such as a sample of college students. This would not be able to be blanketly applied to people in general, only to other college students.

## Neural Nets / AI

Neural Nets and AI agents are extremely sophistocated algorithms which are able to learn and fine tune from labeled data. The general process for making an AI agent is to first gather, sort, and label data. Then take that data and split it into two groups, the testing and the training group, then feed teh data to the model in waves, each time it will learn more and calculate its loss function. After all the iterations of seeing the dataset, the system will find the epoch with the lowest loss function and make that the final state of the model, a process called back propogation. 

### How Neural Nets Differ from Classical Algorithms

These models differ from classical algorithms in many ways, the main way being complexity. Many times these AI systems are black boxes where the process that turns the input into the output is not clear or easily understandible. Classical algorithms generally should be explainable and able to trace why exactly one input turned into its respective output.

## Technological Worldviews

### Technological Utopianism

The idea that technology will promote and or lead to a near perfect society. 


### Tech-Solutionism

The idea that every problem, social or political, has a technological solution.

## Moral Status & Consciousness

### Moral Status

Moral status is the line defining whether or not a specific thing needs to be treated with respect for their well being. 

### The Hard Problem of Consciousness

Conciousness is extremely difficult to measure and almost impossible to prove. The only way we are able to deduce conciousness is by seeing traits that are similar to human traits, and assuming that those traits imply conciousness. This would be things like pain. 

### The Problem of Other Minds

The idea that you could be the only concious person and everyone else could walking around subconciously. Becuase there is almost no way to prove conciousness, it is impossible to even prove that other humans are conciouss.

## Human Enhancement & Transhumanism

### Transhumanism  

The practice of modifying human biology with technology. Current tranhuman devices are mostly centered around helping disabled people to restore their lost functions, but future devices include chips like nueralink. 

### Moral Issues Raised by Transhumanism

At what point of modification does a person no longer become a person and is at that point a robot? Should people with calculators in their brain be seen as smart or just seen as devices. Once we get into the realm of upgrading our biology with technology, we blur the line of what is human and what is not, what has moral status and what doesn't and more.

## Surveillance & Power

### Surveillance Capitalism  

The phenonmenon when large companies collect analyze and sell personal data in order to better predict peoples actoins to maximize profit. 

### Data Colonialism  



### The Panopticon / Panopticonism  

The panopticon is orginally a prison design from teh 1800s. The idea of panopticism is that by making the people believe there is the constant threat that they are being watched, those people will self regulate and act better, regardless of if they are actually being watched or not. 

### Power  
### Workplace Surveillance  
### Algorithmic Domination

## Gamification & Value

### Gamification  

The act of amking something game like. Humans have a natural leniency towards games due to their clear goals and easy to determine metrics, so by gamifying things it tends to increase user engagement. 

### Value Capture

---

## Social Epistemology

### Social Epistemology  
### Testimony  
### Epistemic Bubbles  

People who only hear things that they already believe in which cause them to go even deeper into that hole and possibly believe that there is no way people could think anything else. This can be a personal choice or just because of algorithms. 

### Echo Chambers  

When the other viewpoint is heard but actively discredited. 

### Political Polarization  



### The Public Sphere / Digital Public Sphere
